<p>Configure which cars and tracks are available for your championships by scanning your Assetto Corsa installation.</p>
<p>Later, you will be able to filter by class, view metadata (e.g., car performance, track length), and mark favorites.</p>
<p>Once scanning is implemented, this page will show detected mods and allow you to enable or disable specific entries.</p>
